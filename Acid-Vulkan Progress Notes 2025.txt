Issues:
- (X)Some triangles not visible - likely vertex order
- Resizing window causes crash if enlarging, but ok if going smaller
- Resizing window causes image to scale instead of crop
- (X)Object not centered
- (X)Validation layer error related to descriptors - may be timing related because it doesn't happen when loading the larger scene? But also that scene just doesn't seem to render

How to use descriptors:
Define the actual data - anything from transform matrices or buffer addresses to image views, samplers, and layout
Define the layout - vkDescriptorSetLayout?
{ begin: material descriptor setup
Allocate a descriptor set (locally? using DescriptorAllocatorGrowable)
"Write" values to it (does not actually call any Vulkan functions?)
updateSet to assign set address and write data to GPU? andvkUpdateDescriptorSets
} end: material descriptor setup
vkCmdBindDescriptorSets


What is needed for material descriptors:
data buffer handle (for texture data? or for color_factors + metal_rough_factors type data?) Requires 256 byte alignment?
Image (texture?) write elements - view, sampler, layout
